Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Delayed Delivery

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the delayed delivery of our order #ORD12345.
We were expecting the package to be delivered by 25th May 2025, but it has not arrived yet.
This delay is affecting our operations significantly.

Please look into the matter urgently and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Regards,
Kushal Dubey
IBM Global
